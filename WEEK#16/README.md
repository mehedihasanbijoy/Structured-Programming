      <p>Declare the structure* needed for your project. Declare a 100 element array of that structure. Also declare an integer variable called num (with initial value zero) which indicates the number of valid (i.e., elements read from user) elements in that array of structure variables. Declare the structure, array of structure, and num globally (outside all functions) and declare them before main function.
* If you need more than one struct, you must declare them as well; for e.g. when you want to use a nested structure.
